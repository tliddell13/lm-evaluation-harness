He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\nA: Let's think step by step\n\nJason started with 20 lollipops.\n\nThen he had 12 after giving some to Denny.\n\nSo he gave Denny 20 - 12 = 8.\n\nThe answer is 8.\n\n#### 8 \n\nQ: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?\nA: Let's think step by step\n\nShawn started with 5 toys.\n\nIf he got 2 toys each from his mom and dad, then that is 4 more toys.\n\n5 + 4 = 9.\n\nThe answer is 9.\n\n#### 9 \n\nQ: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?\nA: Let's think step by step\n\nThere were originally 9 computers.\n\nFor each of 4 days, 5 more computers were added.\n\nSo 5 * 4 = 20 computers were added.\n\n9 + 20 is 29.\n\nThe answer is 29.\n\n#### 29 \n\nQ: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?\nA: Let's think step by step\n\nMichael started with 58 golf balls.\n\nAfter losing 23 on tuesday, he had 58 - 23 = 35.\n\nAfter losing 2 more, he had 35 - 2 = 33 golf balls.\n\nThe answer is 33.\n\n#### 33 \n\nQ: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step\n\nOlivia had 23 dollars.\n\n5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.\n\nSo she has 23 - 15 dollars left.\n\n23 - 15 is 8.\n\nThe answer is 8.#### 8 \n\n
